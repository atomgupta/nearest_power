# nearest_power
You are given two numbers a and b. When a is raised to some power p, we get a number x. Now, you need to find what is the value of x that is closest to b.  Input Format: The first line of input contains T denoting the number of testcases. T testcases follow. Each testcase contains two lines of input. The first line contains a and second line contains b.  Output Format: For each testcase, in a new line, print the closest power.  Your Task: This is a function problem. You do not need to take any input. Complete the function nearestPower and return the answer.  Constraints: 1 &lt;= T &lt;= 100 2 &lt;= a &lt;= 100 a &lt;= b &lt;= 108
